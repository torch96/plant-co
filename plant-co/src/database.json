The leaves are normally squat and broad, measuring up to 12 inches (30 cm) long and up to 8 inches (21 cm) wide. The root system is extensive, and will break containers if it needs more room. This root system must be observed on an annual basis in order to re-pot before pot breakage occurs.",

    "light": "This plant requires at least four hours of indirect, but bright, sunlight a day. Do not permit this plant to be exposed to overly bright or direct sunlight. Too much sun will burn the leaves and cause the green parts to turn brown.",
    "watering": "The Aluminum plant needs to be watered differently during different times of the year. During spring and summer, the top quarter inch of the soil should be kept moist. During fall and winter, allow the top quarter inch of soil to dry out before watering again. Do not permit water to stand in the saucer underneath the plant."

    "description": "The Queens tears plant is a surprisingly resilient bromeliad that can withstand periods of neglect. Their multi-colored blooms make them a sure crowd pleaser and a stunning addition to any home garden. Bromeliads do not get much easier to grow than the Billbergia nutans, indoors.",

    "temperature": "This plant is picky about the temperature that it likes to live at. Depending on the season, your plant will demand different temperatures in order to maintain its health. In the summer, offer the plant a spot that is 65-80ºF (18-27ºC). In the fall, winter, and cooler spring months, the plant needs a 60-75ºF (16-24ºC) temperature. During the coldest winter, occasional periods can be withstood up to 40ºF (4ºC), but extended exposure will affect the coming year's bloom.",
    "light": "During the summer, provide partial shade to Billbergia nutans. At other times of the year, bright but indirect light is required for the plant's health. Full summer sunlight can destroy the flowers.",
    "watering": "Because of the shallow nature of the roots, the Queens tears gathers most of its moisture from the air and directly from the leaves and flowers. During the summer months, the leaves, flowers, and roots should be watered daily to keep them moist, but never soggy. Any flower cups pointing upward may be filled with water and allowed to sit. During the fall, winter, and cooler parts of spring, the plant should be misted every few days and watered enough to keep the soil just shy of dry."

Once it has been watered, allow the soil to dry completely before watering again. Do not allow water to sit in the saucer underneath this plant. The cup of the flower must be kept filled with 1 to 2 inches of water at all times. Every four days, pour the old water out of the cup and provide new water. Never use anything except distilled or rain-sourced water, as the chemicals in processed water will kill the plant."
